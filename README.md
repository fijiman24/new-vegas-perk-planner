### Basic perk planner for Fallout: New Vegas.

**How to Use:**
1. Add points to Level using the buttons, or enter a value by tapping the number.
2. Add points to S.P.E.C.I.A.L. attributes using the buttons, or enter values by tapping the numbers.
3. Tag 3 skills using the checkboxes to the left of the skill names.
4. Add points to skills using the buttons, or enter values by tapping the numbers.
5. Select perks from the scrollable perk menu.
6. Click and drag perks in the planner to plan what perk you will take at each level. Only 1 perk every even level.
7. Optional: add implants by clicking the checkboxes beside S.P.E.C.I.A.L. attributes

**Limitations:**
1. A "perk" planner, not a fully build planner. No ability for weapons, armor, food, etc.
2. Only "regular" perks shown. That is, perks gained through levelling. Companion and challenge perks are not included.

Made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Only external library used was Sortable.js for drag and drop functionality in planner.

Thanks to the Independent Fallout Wiki (https://fallout.wiki/) for providing information on, well, everything. From formulas, to perk requirements, to attribute descriptions.

Thanks to https://github.com/octopushugs/nvperkslist/blob/master/nvperks.json so I didn't have to copy all the perk descriptions.
